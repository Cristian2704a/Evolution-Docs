| Method | Endpoint                                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| POST   | {{baseUrl}}/message/sendText/{{instance}} |

Send a message in a group, mentioning one or several participants, without the need to include @name in the message content.

:::info Note:
Use this feature sparingly, as in a group where participants have chosen to mute notifications, they will still be notified and tagged with the @.

Excessive use in a group with many members in this condition may cause dissatisfaction and result in an effect contrary to the desired one.
