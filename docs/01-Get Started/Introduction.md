# Introduction

This is a **COMPLETELY FREE** project, aiming to support small shopkeepers, entrepreneurs, self-employed professionals, and people with limited purchasing power. The goal is to enhance local or digital businesses with a WhatsAppâ„¢ messaging solution via API.

## Objective

The content of this documentation is designed to be easy to understand and implement, even for users who are not familiar with technical procedures or systems. Efforts have been made to be as didactic as possible, anticipating potential errors and suggesting likely solutions.

## Community Support

For any inquiries, join our dedicated Discord Channel for individuals interested in Evolution-API. Visit [Evolution-API Discord](https://evolution-api.com/discord) for support and community discussions.

## Important Recommendations

Before starting the installation, **please read all recommendation before installation**:

1. This script is based on the **DEBIAN distribution, version 11 LTS 64bits**.
2. Tests were not conducted on other distributions, versions, or VPSs other than Hetzner.
3. A clean VPS was used for testing, without any other apps or services installed, to avoid conflicts unrelated to the Evolution API.
4. **Local installation is not recommended**, regardless of the operating system.
5. **Avoid installations without using a reverse proxy**. Direct access through IP + Port (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:8080`) is discouraged.
6. While some users have successfully installed in various scenarios (other providers, local installation, Windows installation, usage and access without reverse proxy), these may require additional steps like port forwarding, additional apps, or specific settings not covered in this tutorial.
7. Any installation method deviating from this tutorial is **AT THE USER'S OWN DISCRETION AND RESPONSIBILITY**.
