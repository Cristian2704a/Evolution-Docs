:::danger Warning:
It is extremely necessary that the payload obey the rules for creating a JSON file, considering the correct arrangement of items, formatting, square brackets, braces and commas, etc.

Before consuming the endpoint, if you have questions about the JSON formatting, go to https://jsonlint.com/ and validate.
