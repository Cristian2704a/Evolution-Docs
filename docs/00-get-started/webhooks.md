# Webhooks

## SUPPORTED WEBHOOK EVENTS

Webhooks enable real-time integration between the Evolution API and WhatsAppâ„¢, allowing automated data synchronization and sharing.

It is exactly this feature that enables the creation of self-service bots and multi-service systems.

These are the available and supported webhook events::

## WEBHOOK ROUTES

When enabling the WEBHOOK_BY_EVENTS options in the global and local webhooks, the following paths will be added at the end of the webhook.

:::note Example:
Assuming your webhook url was `https://sub.domain.com/webhook-test/exclusive-webhook-code`, for the `QRCODE_UPDATED` event the complete url would look like this:

`https://sub.domain.com/webhook-test/exclusive-webhook-code/qrcode-updated`
