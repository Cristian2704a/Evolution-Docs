Webhooks enable real-time integration between the Evolution API and WhatsAppâ„¢, allowing automated data synchronization and sharing.

It is exactly this feature that enables the creation of self-service bots and multi-service systems.

## Activating webhooks

There is two ways to activate the webhook:
  - In the `.env` with global events
  - By calling the endpoint `/webhook/instance`

### Instance webhook events

Most of the users will prefer the activation by instance, this way is easier to control the events that are received, however in some cases a global webhook is needed this could be done by using the global webhook variable.

Here is an example with some commonly listened events:

```json title="/webhook/instance" showLineNumbers
{
  "url": "{{webhookUrl}}",
    "webhook_by_events": false,
    "webhook_base64": false,
    "events": [
        "QRCODE_UPDATED",
        "MESSAGES_UPSERT",
        "MESSAGES_UPDATE",
        "MESSAGES_DELETE",
        "SEND_MESSAGE",
        "CONNECTION_UPDATE",
        "TYPEBOT_START",
        "TYPEBOT_CHANGE_STATUS"
    ]    
}
```

### Global Webhook events 

Each instance's Webhook URL and events will be requested at the time it is created
Define a global webhook that will listen for enabled events from all instances

```bash title="Global events env example"
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_URL=''
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_ENABLED=false

# With this option activated, you work with a url per webhook event, respecting the global url and the name of each event
WEBHOOK_GLOBAL_WEBHOOK_BY_EVENTS=false

## Set the events you want to hear, all listed events below are supported
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_APPLICATION_STARTUP=false
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_QRCODE_UPDATED=true

# Some extra events for errors
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_ERRORS=false
WEBHOOK_EVENTS_ERRORS_WEBHOOK=
```
## Supported events

These are the available and supported webhook events:

## WEBHOOK ROUTES

When enabling the WEBHOOK_BY_EVENTS options in the global and local webhooks, the following paths will be added at the end of the webhook.

:::note Example:
Assuming your webhook url was `https://sub.domain.com/webhook-test/exclusive-webhook-code`, for the `QRCODE_UPDATED` event the complete url would look like this:

`https://sub.domain.com/webhook-test/exclusive-webhook-code/qrcode-updated`
